    Server Side Algorithms (SSA) is a platform with the objective to cover the gap between applications developers and scientists. Through a standard API described in our <a href="https://server-side-algorithms.herokuapp.com/">Documentation</a>, the registered developers are allowed to send HTTP requests to our server by requiring the execution of a specific algorithm on the provided data.

  <p align="justify">
    In this way, developers with no scientific background have the opportunity to incorporate in their own applications complex algorithms and procedures, which have been developed by the experts of the sector and reviewed by our representatives.
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
    On the other hand, scientists with a solid background in algorithms, high-performance computing, combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and many other fields, can upload on the platform their implementations. In this way, they will gain visibility and will have the opportunity to earn from the platform safely and without any need to incorporate their algorithms in an application or spend time in the development of a user interface.

## About The Project

![screen](/static/screenshot.png)


### Why Server Side Algorithms


Server Side Algorithms (SSA) is a self-maintained project. The idea comes from the necessity of some scientists very busy in their academic work to monetize and provide visibility to their creations. This platform constitutes a meeting point where scientists and developers more experienced in production software may benefit from each other.

Our representatives provide safety of the infrastructure, and an accurate revision of all the solutions and relative documentation uploaded on the platform. To be accepted, an algorithm must be provided in readable ` Python >= 3.8 ` code and its documentation must respect the standards and guidelines required.

The initial service will be very basic, but we have intention to provide a more accurate documentation, and a more and more powerful server as the number of users increase. 
  
You can find our documentation at the following link: [Documentation](https://server-side-algorithms.herokuapp.com/).

### Built With

* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



## Usage

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* FastAPI
  ```sh
  pip install fastapi
  ```

### Installation

No installation is required. We will provide soon on [GitHub](https://github.com) a set of plug-in to easily communicate with the server by using the most widely used programming languages.
